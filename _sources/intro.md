# Audio Signal Processing Concepts Explained with Python

This Jupyter Book is a collection of interactive notebooks designed to visually explain fundamental concepts in audio signal processing using Python.
Through plots and examples, the book aims to provide an intuitive understanding of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, making them accessible to a broad audience, including students, sound engineers, and music producers.

The book is organized into four main sections:

- **Fundamentals of Audio Signal Processing**: Establishes the Core DSP principles, such as sampling, quantization, and linear systems, laying the groundwork for more advanced topics.
- **Time and Frequency Domain Analysis**: Covers signal analysis, focusing on both time-domain and frequency-domain techniques, essential for any audio processing task.
- **Measuring and Analyzing Audio Signals**: Focuses on tools and methods for practical audio measurement, such as normalization, loudness, and signal descriptors.
- **Room Acoustics**: Covers spatial audio processing, reverb, and techniques for simulating room effects, ideal for sound engineers working with acoustics.
