  abstract = {A novel measurement technique of the transfer function of weak, nonlinear, approximately time-invariant systems is presented. The method has been implemented with low-cost instrumentation and is based on an exponentially swept-sine signal. It is not only applicable to loudspeakers and other audio components but also to room acoustics measurements. The paper presents a theoretical description of the method and an experimental verification in comparison with MLS.},
